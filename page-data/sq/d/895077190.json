{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":"University of Groningen","subtitle":"Hi, I'm Steve!","content":"Interested in complex systems, unconventional computing, human cognition and building wider artificial intelligence.\nI am currently an early stage researcher in the MINDS research group research group in Groningen, as part of the European post-digital training network, supported by the European Commission under Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN Action. During the PhD, I am working on non-digital computing theory with the goal of developing a formalism for exploiting physical phenomena for computation - with particular attention to neuromorphic applications.\nI love to read and occasionally write about topics I am interested in. I enjoy telling stories as a photographer (see portfolio), and a hobby (amateur) film-maker. ","linkTo":"/resume/","linkText":"View My Profile"}}}}
