abstract: 'Bachelor Thesis. Investigated techniques that automate the architecture design for deep neural networks (AutoML), both through neural architecture search and through dynamic learning (i.e. modifying the network structure while learning). Proposed a framework for evaluation. Proposed an extension for the Forward Thinking framework (Hettinger et al, 2017) for increased autonomy.'
