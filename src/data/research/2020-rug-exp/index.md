Joined the MINDS research group at RUG as part of the European post-digital training network. The post-digital goal is to facilitate the interdisciplinary education and research needed for the design and development of unconventional computing systems. At MINDS, we try to understand how intelligent information processing can arise from dynamics in nonlinear material substrates. We are working toward a fundamental theory of computing in brainlike materials, grounded both in physics and mathematics.
